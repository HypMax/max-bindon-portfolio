This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics topics.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will showcase some of my data analytics projects, providing a brief overview, some learning outcomes and results. 

### <u>Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards</u>

### Dietician Consulting Survey Analysis Dashboard

- **Dashboard:** [Tableau dashboard for dietician consultancy end of program survey analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/EndofProgramSurveyAnalysis/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- **Description:** An individual project for a dietician consulting company who needed a detailed analysis of customer survey feedback at the end of a diet program collected over four years. Given the extent of responses with both closed and extensive open ended answers the company wanted to understand the themes raised and trends of satisfaction over a number of question metrics and time. The survey results informed management on service quality control including areas where service delivery could be improved. 
- **Skills:** data vizualisation, stakeholder management, project scoping, data preparation and integration.
- **Technology:** Tableau & natural language processing OpenAI Chat GPT (extracting themes from open questions)
- **Results:** A presentation to the client detailed a number of findings and recommendations. The analysis uncovered concerns within Q1 2023 perceptions of the diet program value for money including the driving themes around this. Furthermore, the analysis  identified some customers struggling and disatisfied with the technologies used, including platforms, used by the program. The client was also able to validate their ideas around developing a program continuation service offering which was raised within numerous responses. In summary the client can now develop strategies around improving their program value for money including a program continuation offering and improving technological gaps within their service.
  
### Data Consultancy Utilization Dashboard 

- **Dashboard:** [Tableau dashboard for data consultancy utilization](https://public.tableau.com/views/Edgedashboardfinal/Dashboardfinaldraft?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- **Description:** A group project to build a dashboard for a data consultancy client who needed an overview of consultant utilization and project typologies to inform strategic decisions such as hiring, skill    development and client acquisition. A key performance indicator tracked was having 85% of their consultantsâ€™ working hours as billable. 
- **Skills:** data vizualisation, stakeholder management, project scoping, data preparation and integration.
- **Technology:** Tableau.
- **Results:** A presentation to the cliented detail a number of findings and recommendations. The recommendations included prioritizing larger project clients for stability, balancing work around key project types to best optimize skills, assessing utilization distribution by role for targeted team development, aligning hiring targets with utilization goals for sustainable growth, standardizing data input for reliability, and integrating data source tables for better quality insights.

### <u>Python Programming</u>

### Crypto Whale Alert Tracker

- **Code:** [crypto-whale-alert-tracker](https://github.com/HypMax/crypto-whale-alert-tracker/blob/main/Whale_Alert_Tracker.py)
- **Description:** An individual project in which a Python script captures, cleans, and categorizes tweets from the "whale_alert" Twitter account, which reports transaction behavior of major players (whales), creating a well-structured dataset. It lays the groundwork for uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations which can then be leveraged to explore connections between transaction behavior of major players (whales) and the price movements of a specific cryptocurrency coin.
- **Skills:** Python programming, API integration, Data cleaning, Cloud storage management.
- **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Tweepy (Twitter API), Google Cloud Storage.
- **Results:** A [relational database of transactions](https://github.com/HypMax/crypto-whale-alert-tracker/blob/main/whale_alert_tweets%20(SAMPLE%20OUTPUT).csv) updating every 24 hours and a separate [junk database](https://github.com/HypMax/crypto-whale-alert-tracker/blob/main/junk_whale_alert_tweets%20(SAMPLE%20OUTPUT).csv) of tweets which don't meet transaction criteria. This database is now ready to be used for more in-depth analysis uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations which can then be leveraged to explore connections between transaction behavior of major players (whales) and the price movements of a specific cryptocurrency coin.
